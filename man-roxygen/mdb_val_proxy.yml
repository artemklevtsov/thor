data:
  short: >-
    Return the value from a proxy object
  params:
    as_raw: >-
      Return the value as a raw vector?  This has the same semantics
      as \code{\link{mdb_env$get}} - if \code{NULL} then the value
      will be returned as a string as possible, otherwise as a raw
      vector.  If \code{TRUE} then the value is always returned as a
      raw vector, and if \code{FALSE} then the value is always
      returned as a string (or an error is thrown if that is not
      possible).
  value: A string or raw vector

is_valid:
  short: >-
    Test if a proxy object is still valid.  Once the proxy is invalid,
    it cannot be read from any more.  Proxies are invalidated if their
    parent transaction is closed, or if any write operations (e.g.,
    `put`, `del`) have occured.
  value: >-
    Scalar logical

size:
  short: >-
    The size of the data - the number of characters in the string, or
    number of bytes in the raw vector.
  value: Scalar integer
