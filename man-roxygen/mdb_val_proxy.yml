data:
  short: >-
    Return the value from a proxy object
  params:
    as_raw: >-
      Return the value as a raw vector?  This has the same semantics
      as \code{mdb_env$get} - if \code{NULL} then the value
      will be returned as a string as possible, otherwise as a raw
      vector.  If \code{TRUE} then the value is always returned as a
      raw vector, and if \code{FALSE} then the value is always
      returned as a string (or an error is thrown if that is not
      possible).
  value: A string or raw vector

head:
  short: >-
    Read the first \code{n} bytes from a proxy
  params:
    n: >-
      The number of bytes to read.  If \code{n} is greater than the
      length of the object the whole object is returned (same
      behaviour as \code{\link{head}}
    as_raw: As for \code{$data()}

is_raw:
  short: >-
    Return whether we know a value to be raw or not.  This is affected
    by whether we have successfully turned the value into a string (in
    which case we can return \code{FALSE}) or if any \code{NULL} bytes
    have been detected.  The latter condition may be satisfied by
    reading the first bit of the proxy with \code{$head()}
  value: >-
    A logical if we can, otherwise \code{NULL} (for symmetry with
    \code{as_raw})

is_valid:
  short: >-
    Test if a proxy object is still valid.  Once the proxy is invalid,
    it cannot be read from any more.  Proxies are invalidated if their
    parent transaction is closed, or if any write operations (e.g.,
    \code{put}, \code{del}) have occurred.
  value: >-
    Scalar logical

size:
  short: >-
    The size of the data - the number of characters in the string, or
    number of bytes in the raw vector.
  value: Scalar integer
